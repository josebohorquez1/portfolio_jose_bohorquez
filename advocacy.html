    <p class="lead mt-3">
      My advocacy spans national and state levels, focused on disability rights,
      accessibility, employment equity, and legislation that impacts blind individuals.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">National Level</h2>
    <p>
      I advocate through the <strong>National Federation of the Blind (NFB)</strong>. 
      I participated in the NFB Washington Seminar in 2021, 2024, and 2025, where I met directly
      with Florida’s U.S. Representatives and Senators to promote federal disability-related legislation.
    </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Accessible Medical Equipment</h3>
    <p>
      Many medical devices are currently inaccessible or prohibitively expensive for blind users.
      I support legislation that requires new medical devices to be accessible by default,
      unless a company can prove undue hardship. This ensures blind individuals can independently
      manage their own health care.
    </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Integrated Competitive Employment & SSI/SSDI</h3>
    <p>
      I advocate for fair employment opportunities for people with disabilities and work to address
      unfair wage practices and benefit barriers.
    </p>
    <ul class="ms-3">
      <li><strong>SSI (Supplemental Security Income):</strong> Needs-based benefit for people with limited income. Benefits are reduced gradually as income increases.</li>
      <li><strong>SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance):</strong> For people previously working who become disabled. Currently, earning above a certain amount can result in a sudden loss of benefits (the "SSDI earnings cliff").</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The legislation I support smooths out the SSDI cliff, encouraging work without penalizing recipients.
      It also aims to end subminimum wages under Section 14(c), which allow disabled workers to be paid far below minimum wage.
    </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Digital Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      I advocate for expanding accessibility requirements, similar to Section 508 for federal agencies,
      to all companies unless they can prove undue burden. This mirrors EU standards and would improve
      accessibility across websites, software, and digital services.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h3 mb-3">State Level</h2>
    <p>
      At the state level, I work with the <strong>National Federation of the Blind of Florida (NFBF)</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Blind Services & APD</h3>
    <p>
      I opposed legislation that would have consolidated blind services into the Agency for Persons
      with Disabilities (APD), as states that have done this often see reduced funding and support.
      Keeping blind services separate ensures focused programs for vocational training and employment outcomes.
    </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Fair Wages & Employment Policies</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve advocated against proposals that would allow certain jobs to be classified in ways that
      permit workers to "volunteer" for pay below Florida’s minimum wage. After Florida voters
      approved a $15/hour minimum wage, we worked to protect people with disabilities from policies
      that would undermine that standard.
