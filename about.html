    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring software engineer with a background in computer science
      and communication studies, focused on building accessible, reliable,
      and purpose-driven software.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in
      Communication Studies from the University of Florida.
      My academic work emphasized software design, problem solving,
      and logic, alongside clear technical communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through coursework and projects, I developed experience with
      front-end and back-end concepts, including data structures,
      programming language design, and standards-based web development.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Approach Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      I approach software engineering with a strong emphasis on clarity,
      maintainability, and accessibility.
      I value code that is readable, well-structured, and built with
      real users in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in building software that solves
      meaningful problems and has a positive real-world impact,
      especially in contexts where usability and inclusion matter.
    </p>

  <h2>Accessibility and Advocacy</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to my technical work, I am actively involved in advocacy at the
    intersection of disability and technology through the National Federation
    of the Blind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this work, I champion issues that directly affect blind users,
    including advancing better accessibility across software, applications,
    programs, and websites. I engage with accessibility standards, usability
    considerations, and real-world user needs to help promote technology that
    is usable by everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    This advocacy experience strongly informs how I approach software
    engineering, reinforcing the idea that accessibility is not a feature to
    add later, but a fundamental aspect of quality, user-centered design.
  </p>
</section>
  <section>
    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p>
      I am seeking opportunities where I can continue to grow as a software
      engineer while contributing to products and teams that value
      thoughtful design, accessibility, and impact.
