            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>
            This site showcases my work as a software engineer. It highlights
            selected projects, technical skills, and advocacy efforts, with a focus
            on accessibility, thoughtful engineering, and real-world impact.
            </p>
            <p>
            The site itself is intentionally built using semantic HTML, mobile-first
            CSS, and plain JavaScript to prioritize performance, accessibility, and
            maintainability.
